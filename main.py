# Create a game that does the following:

# 1. Shows the name, handle, and bio of two randomly selected influencers from the dataset.

# 2. Takes user input to guess which of the two influencers has more followers.

# 3. Evaluates which influencer has more followers and compares the correct answer to the user's guess.

# 4. Upon a correct guess, brings up a new random influencer to compare to the "winner" of the prior round.

# 5. Upon an incorrect guess, selects two entirely new influencers at random from the remaining options.

# 6. Keeps track of how many times the user guesses incorrectly.

# 7. Ends the game after 5 incorrect guesses.

# 8. Ensures no "losing" influencer is offered to the user more than once.
